# JavaScript Practice Problems 👨‍💻🚀

Welcome to my JavaScript Practice Problems repository! This collection contains solutions to coding challenges provided by 10,000 Coders institute, which I completed to enhance my JavaScript skills. 

## About 10,000 Coders 🏫

I'm part of the 10,000 Coders program, an initiative focused on training individuals in software development. As part of the program, we tackle various coding challenges to solidify our understanding of programming concepts.

## What's Inside? 🗂️

This repository contains JavaScript solutions to problems across three levels of difficulty:

* **Easy**: Beginner-friendly problems to get started with JavaScript fundamentals. 🌱
* **Medium**: Intermediate-level challenges that require a deeper understanding of concepts. ☕
* **Hard**: Complex problems that test your problem-solving abilities and coding proficiency. 🔥

The problems were provided in a PDF format ("JS Practice Problems.docx.pdf"), which is also included in this repository for reference.

## How to Use ⚙️

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone [repository URL] 
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Folders**: Go to the respective folders (Easy, Medium, Hard) to find the JavaScript solutions.

3. **Explore the Code**:  Each problem solution is in its own file.  Read through the code to understand the logic and approach.

4. **Refer to the PDF**: Check the "JS Practice Problems.docx.pdf" file for the original problem statements.

## Why This Repository? 🤔

This repository serves as a record of my learning journey and a resource for anyone looking to practice JavaScript coding challenges. I believe that practicing coding problems is crucial for mastering any programming language.
